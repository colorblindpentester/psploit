This directory contains EPS files which can be overlayed on
other people' print jobs (if they use PostScript as printer
driver) by using PRET's `overlay' command in `ps' mode. You
can add and overlay custom EPS files of course. Create them
on your own or get them from some vector graphics portal.

Let the printer pranks begin!
