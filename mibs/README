This directory contains general-purpose and printer-related MIBs.
From PRET v0.32 on we switched from snimpy to pysnmp and the MIB
files are no longer required. It would still be worth assembling
a collection of MIBs from the various printer manufacturers here
and analyze which features can be activated through SNMP or PML.
