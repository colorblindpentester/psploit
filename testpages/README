This directory contains PostScript and PCL files which can be sent
directly to a printer using netcat on port 9100/tcp or the `print'
command of PRET. Using the `print' command, you can also directly
(without installing a printer driver) print other image files and
documents, not understood by the printer if ImageMagick's convert
comand and GhostScript are installed for conversion.
